# Bobun-R-Pho
A neural network classifier using Tensorflow and Keras to tell the difference between a Bobun or a Pho.
It's a personal project unrelated to any academic assignement.

## Development
- Conception part (Putting images in proper format (cv2), Creating and Training the network (Tensorflow/Keras), Choosing best model (Tensorborad)) was made using Jupyter Notebook.
- After picking the best model, I implemented a small program in Python to predict the images's label and made a GUI using Qt Designer.
- Packed the whole program in an .exe using py-to-exe.
